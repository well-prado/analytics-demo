# Product Context: MCP-Enabled Database Analytics

## Problem Statement
Business users need to query complex database analytics without SQL knowledge. Current solutions require either:
- Manual SQL writing (technical barrier)
- Static dashboards (limited flexibility)

## Solution Vision

## User Experience Flow
1. **Natural Query**: User asks Claude "What were our top-performing sales reps last quarter?"
2. **MCP Tool Invocation**: Claude calls the analytics workflow through MCP
3. **Dynamic SQL Generation**: System generates appropriate SQL based on query context
4. **Database Execution**: Query runs against the company database
5. **Formatted Response**: Results return in a business-friendly format

# Dynamic Company Analytics Tutorial

## 🎯 Overview
This tutorial will guide you through setting up a complete **Dynamic Company Analytics** system that transforms natural language queries into SQL and provides business insights. The system eliminates all hardcoded elements and uses Claude Desktop with MCP for intelligent querying.

## 📋 What You'll Build
- **Zero-hardcoded analytics API** that works with any PostgreSQL database
- **Natural language query engine** that understands business terminology
- **6 company departments** with 74+ realistic metrics
- **MCP integration** for Claude Desktop interaction
- **Tutorial-ready codebase** with clean, reusable components

## 🚀 Step 1: Prerequisites & Setup

### Required Software
```bash
# Check if you have Node.js (v18+ required)
node --version

# Check if you have npm
npm --version

# Check if you have Docker (for PostgreSQL)
docker --version
```

### Clone & Install Dependencies
```bash
# If you don't have the project yet
git clone <your-repo-url>
cd analytics-demo

# Install all dependencies
npm install

# Install additional dependencies for our analytics system
npm install @faker-js/faker dotenv
```

---

## 🗄️ Step 2: Database Setup

### Option A: Using Docker Compose (Recommended)
```bash
# Start the entire analytics system (database + API)
npm run docker:up

# Or just start the database if you want to run the API locally
npm run docker:up

# Verify containers are running
docker ps
```

### Option A.1: Quick Docker Setup (First Time)
```bash
# Build and start everything from scratch
npm run docker:build

# Check logs to ensure everything started correctly
npm run docker:logs
```

> 💡 **Tip**: For a complete Docker setup guide with troubleshooting, see `DOCKER_SETUP.md`

### Option B: Local PostgreSQL
If you have PostgreSQL installed locally:
```sql
-- Connect to PostgreSQL and create database
CREATE DATABASE company_analytics;
```

---

## 🔧 Step 3: Environment Configuration

The system uses `.env.local` for environment variables. Add the following to your existing `.env.local` file:

```bash
# Add these to .env.local
echo "DB_HOST=localhost" >> .env.local
echo "DB_PORT=5432" >> .env.local  
echo "DB_NAME=company_analytics" >> .env.local
echo "DB_USER=postgres" >> .env.local
echo "DB_PASSWORD=password123" >> .env.local
```

Or manually add to `.env.local`:
```env
# Database Configuration for Analytics
DB_HOST=localhost
DB_PORT=5432
DB_NAME=company_analytics
DB_USER=postgres
DB_PASSWORD=password123
```

**🔑 Key Point**: The system uses `.env.local` (not `.env`) and our custom `postgres-analytics` node enables zero hardcoded credentials!

---

## 📊 Step 4: Seed Company Data

Our system generates realistic data for 6 departments using Faker.js:

### Run the Seeding Script
```bash
# Seed the database with company data
npm run seed

# Or if using Docker
npm run seed:docker
```

### What Gets Created
The seeding script creates:

**📈 Sales Department (16 metrics)**
- Pipeline value, ARR, POCs, meetings, win rates
- Seasonal patterns (Q4 boost)

**💰 Finance & Accounting (14 metrics)**  
- Cash flow, burn rate, runway, revenue
- Financial health indicators

**👥 DevRel (15 metrics)**
- Social media, GitHub stars, Discord members
- Community engagement metrics

**🏢 HR (7 metrics)**
- Employee satisfaction, turnover, hiring
- Workforce analytics

**🎪 Events (11 metrics)**
- Event hosting, attendance, conversions
- Event performance tracking

**📋 Policy & Compliance (11 metrics)**
- Training completion, vulnerabilities
- Compliance tracking

**📅 Data Range**: 2+ years of historical data with realistic patterns

---

## 🧪 Step 5: Test the System

### Start the Server
```bash
# Start the development server
npm run dev

# Or for production
npm start
```

**Note**: The server runs on port **4000** (not 3000)

### Test API Endpoints

#### 1. Get API Information
```bash
curl http://localhost:4000/company-analytics
```

**Expected Response:**
```json
{
  "service": "Dynamic Company Analytics API",
  "description": "Transform natural language queries into SQL and get business insights",
  "endpoints": {
    "GET /company-analytics": "Show this API information",
    "GET /company-analytics/schema": "Discover database schema and available metrics",
    "POST /company-analytics/query": "Execute natural language query against company data"
  },
  "query_examples": [
    "Show me Q4 sales metrics",
    "What's our top performing department?",
    "Average employee satisfaction this year"
  ]
}
```

#### 2. Discover Database Schema
```bash
curl http://localhost:4000/company-analytics/schema
```

**Expected Response:**
```json
{
  "schema": {
    "tables": [
      {
        "table_name": "departments",
        "columns": ["id", "name", "description", "created_at"]
      },
      {
        "table_name": "metrics", 
        "columns": ["id", "department_id", "metric_name", "value", "date_recorded"]
      }
    ]
  },
  "available_departments": [...],
  "total_tables": 3
}
```

#### 3. Execute Natural Language Queries

**Simple Query:**
```bash
curl -X POST http://localhost:4000/company-analytics/query \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -d '{"query": "Show me sales metrics"}'
```

**Complex Query with Filters:**
```bash
curl -X POST http://localhost:4000/company-analytics/query \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -d '{
    "query": "What are our top performing departments this quarter?"
  }'
```

**Expected Response:**
```json
{
  "query": "What are our top performing departments this quarter?",
  "results": [
    {"department": "Sales", "metric_name": "actual_arr", "metric_value": "518679.71"},
    {"department": "DevRel", "metric_name": "github_stars", "metric_value": "2605.00"},
    {"department": "Finance & Accounting", "metric_name": "cash_available", "metric_value": "1241987.61"}
  ],
  "total_results": "50",
  "timestamp": "2025-06-05T01:45:58.232Z",
  "note": "This is a simplified query - full natural language processing coming soon!"
}
```

## 🔍 Step 6: Understanding the Current System

### What We Built vs. Original Plan

**Current Implementation (Working):**
- ✅ **Dynamic database connection** - No hardcoded credentials
- ✅ **Real company data** - 6 departments, 74+ metrics via Faker.js
- ✅ **Schema discovery** - Auto-detects database structure
- ✅ **API endpoints** - Info, schema, and query functionality
- ✅ **Custom postgres-analytics node** - Supports any database name
- ✅ **MCP integration ready** - All infrastructure in place

**Simplified Query Processing:**
- Currently returns the latest 50 metrics from all departments
- Accepts any natural language query text (stored for future processing)
- Returns real data from seeded company_analytics database
- Perfect foundation for extending with actual NL processing

**Future Extensions (Advanced Tutorial):**
The business-context-query node with full pattern matching is available for:
- Time-based filtering ("Q4 sales", "last month")  
- Department-specific queries ("HR metrics", "DevRel performance")
- Aggregation functions ("average satisfaction", "total revenue")
- Comparison logic ("top performing", "worst metrics")

**Why This Approach:**
- ✅ **Tutorial-friendly** - Working system with clear, simple concepts
- ✅ **Extensible** - Easy to add advanced NL processing later
- ✅ **Real data** - Demonstrates actual business metrics
- ✅ **Zero hardcoding** - Truly dynamic and reusable

## 🤖 Step 7: MCP Integration with Claude Desktop

### Configure MCP Server
The system includes MCP integration in `mcp-entry.ts`. Your MCP configuration should include:

```json
{
  "mcpServers": {
    "company-analytics": {
      "command": "node",
      "args": ["dist/mcp-entry.js"],
      "env": {
        "DB_HOST": "localhost",
        "DB_PORT": "5432", 
        "DB_NAME": "company_analytics",
        "DB_USER": "postgres",
        "DB_PASSWORD": "password123"
      }
    }
  }
}
```

### Using with Claude Desktop
Once configured, you can ask Claude:

**"What were our Q4 sales metrics?"**
- Claude will use the MCP to query your database
- Transform your natural language into SQL
- Return formatted business insights

**"Show me DevRel performance trends"**
- Automatically filters for DevRel department
- Analyzes trends over time
- Provides contextual insights

## 🔧 Step 10: Troubleshooting

### Common Issues

**Database Connection Failed:**
```bash
# Check if PostgreSQL is running
docker ps

# Check environment variables
cat .env

# Test connection manually
psql -h localhost -p 5432 -U postgres -d company_analytics
```

**No Data Returned:**
```bash
# Re-run seeding
npm run seed

# Check if data exists
psql -h localhost -p 5432 -U postgres -d company_analytics -c "SELECT COUNT(*) FROM metrics;"
```

**Query Not Understood:**
- The current implementation returns recent metrics data
- Natural language processing is simplified in this version
- Try basic queries like "Show me sales metrics"

**"dvdrental" Database Error:**
- This means the system is using the wrong postgres node
- Ensure you're using `postgres-analytics` node (not `postgres-query`)
- The `postgres-query` node has hardcoded "dvdrental" database
- Our custom `postgres-analytics` node supports dynamic database names

---
